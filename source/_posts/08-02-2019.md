Today was the first session coding of coding at school.

I didn't have a real goal for this session, but I wanted to get as close as possible to finishing the header design.

Before starting the session, the header looked like this:

After browsing Dribbble with Javier for inspiration, we found a header design we both liked, and decided I'd use it for inspiration:

I worked on this during the whole hour, mostly tweaking small details:

And here's the final result:
